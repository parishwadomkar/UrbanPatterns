# Urban Patterns: Coding for Assessing Public Disturbance Acts Using Crowdsourced Data

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources from the special lecture delivered at SPA Bhopal on assessing urban patterns of public disturbance acts using crowdsourced data. The focus of this study is on the city of Stockholm, Sweden, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on public behavior.

## Contents
- **Google and Apple Mobility Data Analysis:** Jupyter notebook analyzing mobility data to understand changes in public movement patterns. [Google and Apple Mobility Data Notebook](https://github.com/parishwadomkar/UrbanPatterns/blob/main/Google%20and%20apple%20Mobility%20data.ipynb)
- **Visual Heatmaps:** Scripts for generating heatmaps to visualize spatial patterns of public disturbances. [Visual Heatmaps Notebook](https://github.com/parishwadomkar/UrbanPatterns/blob/main/Visual%20Heatmaps.ipynb)
- **Data and Methods:** Detailed methodology including data covering a 30-month period, types of disturbances (like littering, graffiti, abandoned cars), and statistical models used (ARIMA, Poisson-Gamma-CAR regression models).

## Research Questions
The study addresses several key questions:
1. Are there significant differences in the number of records of public disturbances before and after the stay-at-home orders?
2. Which acts of public disturbance vary the most, controlling for seasonal trends?
3. Is there a shift in the geography of all types of acts of public disturbance?
4. How are parks, transport hubs, and schools associated with acts of public disturbance, after controlling for neighborhood characteristics?

## Study Aim
The aim is to investigate the level and distribution of public disturbance acts in Stockholm before and after the recommended stay-at-home measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Data Analysis
- **Temporal Analysis:** Examines seasonal trends and temporal variations in the dataset.
- **Spatial Analysis:** Focuses on understanding spatial trends and differences in public disturbance acts.
